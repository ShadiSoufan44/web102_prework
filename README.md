# WEB102 Prework - **A Crowdfunding Adventure**

Submitted by: **Shadi Soufan**

**Name of your app** A Crowdfunding Adventure is a website for the company Sea Monster Crowdfunding that displays information about the games they have funded.

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] The introduction section explains the background of the company and how many games remain unfunded.
- [x] The Stats section includes information about the total contributions and dollars raised as well as the top two most funded games.
- [x] The Our Games section initially displays all games funded by Sea Monster Crowdfunding
- [x] The Our Games section has three buttons that allow the user to display only unfunded games, only funded games, or all games.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

I implemented a better CSS design to make the website feel more comforting. I enhanced the styling of the header for a more polished look, made the stats container more visually appealing, and improved the the styling of game cards.

## Notes

Some challenges I ran into was being able to display the games from the JSON file. I was having trouble displaying the correct data from each game - every time I tried, the data kept displaying "undefined" until I changed the way I was referring to the JSON. I also had a little but of trouble with the filtering on the buttons - for some reason I messed up the addition, so I was getting incorrect numbers for the total amount funded so far.
